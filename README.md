## Problem A Statement: 
The ugliness of a string is defined as the count of two consecutive ones i.e. **"11"** in the given string. For example, the ugliness of string **"10111"** is **2**.

You are given an array **A** of **N** integers and you have to find any ordering of the array such that the ugliness of the concatenated string of the binary representations of the integers (without leading zeros) is minimum.

### Input:
The first line of the input contains an integer **T** denoting the number of test cases. Then **T** test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer **N**.
The second line contains N space-separated integers  **A1,A2,â€¦,AN**

### Output:
For each test case, output an ordering of **A** such that the ugliness of the array is minimum. If there are multiple answers, you may output any.

### Testcases:
2   
3  
3 6 5  
2   
7 6

## Required Output:
5 6 3  
6 7


## Problem B Statement:

### Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer **T** denoting the number of test cases. The description of **T** test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers **A** and **B**

### Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing the string **"Yes"** if Chef can win the game in a finite number of moves and **"No"** otherwise (without quotes). You can print **"Yes"** or **"No"** in any case.

### Testcases:
2
1 2
2 3

## Required Output:
Yes
No
